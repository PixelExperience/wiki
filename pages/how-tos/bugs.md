## Reporting a bug

[Logcats]({{ "help/logcat/" | relative_url}}) *must* be attached for all android bugs, and *must* be captured right after reproducing the issue.

We're working a on issue tracker portal, for now you can report bugs and tag your maintainer on [our Telegram group](https://t.me/pixelexperiencechat).
