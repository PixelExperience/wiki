## CFW installation

#### What is a CFW?

The A10 Custom Firmware, or CFW for short, is a combination of multiple Xiaomi firmware packages.

#### Why do I need it?

You are probably aware of the leaked factory firmware for the Redmi Note 8 Pro. This firmware contains a preloader which was compiled with the download code.
Since the preloader does not need to setup platform security it allows us to unbrick without an authorized account.

Unfortunately, the MIUI bootloader do not run on the factory preloader - only the factory bootloader does, which works just fine with A9 kernels.

Furthermore, the A10 kernel source released by Xiaomi does not work with the factory bootloader/preloader, which was the reason I worked on a new kernel source based on Android 9 (A9) with several Android 10 (A10) drivers to work nicely with the A10 blobs.

In short, the CFW enables you to use the new builds without worrying about bricks while running newer proprietary vendor software.

1. Download CFW zip from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/begonia-pe/files/PE%20_A10/Flash_CFW%2BTWRP%5BOnly%20For%20PE%20A10%5D.zip/download)
2. Unpack the `.zip` package
3. Run `!_FLASH_IT_W.bat` on Windows or `!_FLASH_IT_L.sh` on Linux
