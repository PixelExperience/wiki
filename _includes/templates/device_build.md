## Introduction

These instructions will hopefully assist you to start with a stock {{ device.vendor }} {{ device.name }}, unlock the bootloader (if necessary), and then download
the required tools as well as the very latest source code for PixelExperience (based on Google’s Android operating system) for your device. Using these, you can build both
a PixelExperience installation zip and a PixelExperience Recovery image and install them on your device.

It is difficult to say how much experience is necessary to follow these instructions. While this guide is certainly not for the extremely uninitiated,
these steps shouldn’t require a PhD in software development either. Some readers will have no difficulty and breeze through the steps easily.
Others may struggle over the most basic operation. Because people’s experiences, backgrounds, and intuitions differ, it may be a good idea to read through
just to ascertain whether you feel comfortable or are getting over your head.

Remember, you assume all risk of trying this, but you will reap the rewards! It’s pretty satisfying to boot into a fresh operating system you baked at home :).
And once you’re an Android-building ninja, there will be no more need to wait for “nightly” builds from anyone. You will have at your fingertips the skills to
build a full operating system from code and install it to a running device, whenever you want. Where you go from there-- maybe you’ll add a feature, fix a bug, add a translation,
or use what you’ve learned to build a new app or port to a new device-- or maybe you’ll never build again-- it’s all really up to you.

### What you'll need

* A {{ device.vendor }} {{ device.name }}.
* A relatively recent 64-bit computer (Linux, macOS, or Windows) with a reasonable amount of RAM and about 100 GB of free storage (more if you enable `ccache`
 or build for multiple devices). The less RAM you have, the longer the build will take (aim for 8 GB or more). Using SSDs results in considerably faster
 build times than traditional hard drives.
* A USB cable compatible with the {{ device.vendor }} {{device.name}}.
* A decent internet connection and reliable electricity. :)
* Some familiarity with basic Android operation and terminology. It would help if you've installed custom roms on other devices and are familiar with recovery.
 It may also be useful to know some basic command line concepts such as `cd`, which stands for “change directory”, the concept of directory hierarchies, and that in Linux they are separated by /, etc.

{% include alerts/tip.html content="If you are not accustomed to using Linux, this is an excellent chance to learn. It’s free -- just download and run a virtual machine (VM) such as
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org), then install a Linux distribution such as [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com) ([AOSP vets Ubuntu as well](https://source.android.com/source/initializing.html)).
Any recent 64-bit version should work great, but the latest Long Term Support (LTS) version is recommended. There are plenty of instructions on setting up VirtualBox to run Ubuntu, so we'll leave that to you." %}

Let's begin!

## Build PixelExperience and PixelExperience Recovery

{% include alerts/note.html content="You only need to do these steps once. If you have already prepared your build environment and downloaded the source code,
skip to [Prepare the device-specific code](#prepare-the-device-specific-code)" %}

### Install the platform-tools

If you haven't previously installed `adb` and `fastboot`, you can [download them from Google](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-linux.zip).
Extract it running:

```
unzip platform-tools-latest-linux.zip -d ~
```

{% include alerts/tip.html content="The file may not be named identically to what stands in this command, so adjust accordingly." %}

Now you have to add `adb` and `fastboot` to your PATH. Open `~/.profile` and add the following:

```
# add Android SDK platform tools to path
if [ -d "$HOME/platform-tools" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/platform-tools:$PATH"
fi
```

Then, run `source ~/.profile` to update your environment.

### Install the build packages

Several packages are needed to build PixelExperience. You can install these using your distribution's package manager.

{% include alerts/tip.html content="A [package manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager) in Linux is a system used to install or remove software
(usually originating from the Internet) on your computer. With Ubuntu, you can use the Ubuntu Software Center. Even better, you may also use the `apt-get install`
command directly in the Terminal." %}

{%- capture cpu_architecture %}
{%- if device.architecture.cpu -%}
   {{ device.architecture.cpu }}
{%- else -%}
   {{ device.architecture }}
{%- endif -%}
{%- endcapture -%}

To build PixelExperience, you'll need:

* `bc bison build-essential ccache curl flex g++-multilib gcc-multilib git gnupg gperf imagemagick
   lib32ncurses5-dev lib32readline-dev lib32z1-dev liblz4-tool libncurses5 libncurses5-dev
   libsdl1.2-dev libssl-dev libxml2 libxml2-utils lzop pngcrush rsync
   schedtool squashfs-tools xsltproc {% if cpu_architecture contains 'x86' %}yasm {% endif %}
   zip zlib1g-dev`

For Ubuntu versions older than 20.04 (focal), install also:

* `libwxgtk3.0-dev`

While for Ubuntu versions older than 16.04 (xenial), install:

* `libwxgtk2.8-dev`

#### Java

Different versions of PixelExperience require different JDK (Java Development Kit) versions.

* PixelExperience Pie-Ten: OpenJDK 1.9 (included by default)

### Create the directories

You'll need to set up some directories in your build environment.

To create them:

```
mkdir -p ~/bin
mkdir -p ~/android/pe
```

The `~/bin` directory will contain the git-repo tool (commonly named "repo") and the `~/android/pe` directory will contain the source code of PixelExperience.

### Install the `repo` command

Enter the following to download the `repo` binary and make it executable (runnable):

```
curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
```

### Put the `~/bin` directory in your path of execution

In recent versions of Ubuntu, `~/bin` should already be in your PATH. You can check this by opening `~/.profile` with a text editor and verifying the following code exists (add it if it is missing):

```
# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists
if [ -d "$HOME/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
fi
```

Then, run `source ~/.profile` to update your environment.


### Configure git
Given that `repo` requires you to identify yourself to sync Android, run the following commands to configure your `git` identity:
```
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

### Initialize the PixelExperience source repository

The following branches can be used to build for the {{ device.vendor }} {{ device.name }}:

{% for version in device.versions %}
* {{ version | replace: "_", "-" }}
{% endfor %}

Enter the following to initialize the repository:

{% include alerts/note.html content="Make sure the branch you enter here is the one you wish to build!" %}

```
cd ~/android/pe
repo init -u https://github.com/PixelExperience/manifest -b branch_name
```

### Download the source code

To start the download of the source code to your computer, type the following:

```
repo sync -j$(nproc --all) -c -j$(nproc --all) --force-sync --no-clone-bundle --no-tags
```

{% include alerts/note.html content="This may take a while, depending on your internet speed. Go and have a beer/coffee/tea/nap in the meantime!" %}

{% include alerts/tip.html content="The `repo sync` command is used to update the latest source code from PixelExperience. Remember it, as you may want to
do it every few days to keep your code base fresh and up-to-date." %}

### Prepare the device-specific code

After the source downloads, ensure you're in the root of the source code (`cd ~/android/pe`), then type:

```
source build/envsetup.sh
lunch {{ device.codename }}-userdebug
```

This will download your device's necessary dependencies.

### Turn on caching to speed up build

Make use of [`ccache`](https://ccache.samba.org/) if you want to speed up subsequent builds by running:

```
export USE_CCACHE=1
export CCACHE_EXEC=/usr/bin/ccache
```

and adding that line to your `~/.bashrc` file. Then, specify the maximum amount of disk space you want `ccache` to use by typing this:

```
ccache -M 50G
```

where `50G` corresponds to 50GB of cache. This needs to be run once. Anywhere from 25GB-100GB will result in very noticeably increased build speeds
(for instance, a typical 1hr build time can be reduced to 20min). If you're only building for one device, 25GB-50GB is fine. If you plan to build
for several devices that do not share the same kernel source, aim for 75GB-100GB. This space will be permanently occupied on your drive, so take this
into consideration.

You can also enable the optional `ccache` compression. While this may involve a slight performance slowdown, it increases the number of files that fit in the cache. To enable it, run:

```
export CCACHE_COMPRESS=1
```

or add that line to your `~/.bashrc` file.

{% include alerts/note.html content="If compression is enabled, the `ccache` size can be lower (aim for approximately 20GB for one device)." %}

### Start the build

Time to start building! Now, type:

```
croot
mka bacon -j$(nproc --all)
```

The build should begin.

## Install the build

Assuming the build completed without errors (it will be obvious when it finishes), type the following in the terminal window the build ran in:

```
cd $OUT
```

There you'll find all the files that were created. The two files of more interest are:

{% if device.is_ab_device %}
1. `boot.img`, which is the PixelExperience boot image, and contains the recovery-ramdisk.
{% else %}
1. `recovery.img`, which is the PixelExperience recovery image.
{% endif %}
2. A zip file whose name starts with 'PixelExperience_', which is the PixelExperience
installer package.

### Success! So... what's next?

You've done it! Welcome to the elite club of self-builders. You've built your operating system from scratch, from the ground up. You are the master/mistress of your domain... and
hopefully you've learned a bit on the way and had some fun too.
